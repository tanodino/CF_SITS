- `DataAugmentation.py`:  an attempt to improve the base classifier by reuse generated CF samples as data augmentation.
- `IF_evaluation.py`: plausibility study (via Isolation forest). Generates confusion matrix images present in the first paper.
- `plot_time_line.py` : plots a timeline based on `dates.txt`.
- `plotSeriesXClass.py`: plots average+std time series signal per class.
- `reject_option.py`: loads model and noiser, creates CF examples, computes accuracy.
